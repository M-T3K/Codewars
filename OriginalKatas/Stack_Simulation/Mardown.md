# Balanced Braces : A Stack Simulation

## Motivation:

This kata was designed to make you find ways to simulate a Stack without the use of a complex data structure by abusing the function call Stack.

## Description

The concept is simple: use the Call Stack in order to check if a String of Braces is balanced. 

**You cannot** use any type of Data Structure that can directly hold more than 1 element as an argument for any function or  method. That means no Strings (other than the one to check), Stacks, Lists, etc...

**You cannot** modify the original String, nor create new ones to help you in the algorithm.

**You can** use the 'String.charAt(int)' method
